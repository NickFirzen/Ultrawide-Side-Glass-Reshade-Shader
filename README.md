# Ultrawide-Side-Glass-Reshade-Shader
Ultrawide Side Glass - Anti Pillarbox Measurement Reshade Shader for ultrawide monitors
such as 21:9/32:9 for 4:3, 16:9 and various 21:9s aspect ratio content masking that leaves the centre screen as is,
but puts some effects on the sides which are otherwise would be black pillar boxes.
It's a small dream came true for me as 32:9 user, been looking forward something like this...

 * UltrawideSideGlass ReShade Shader
 * Fills black pillars on ultrawide monitors with zoomed, mirrored, or crystal-like content.
 * Center: Untouched, passes HDR metadata.
 * Sides: LegacyMirror -> Zoom -> ZoomFlip -> Fisheye -> MirrorPlane -> CrystalView -> FrostedBlur -> BrightnessBoost
 * Supported Aspect Ratios: 16:9, 21:9, 2.35:1, 2.37:1, 2.39:1, 2.40:1, 4:3, 2:1
 * Note: This is a comprehensive shader with all features. For optimal performance, create standalone versions per aspect ratio after finalizing settings.
 *
 * Tested with Media Player Classic x64 and Black Edition, using ReShade 6.5.1. Should work with games and other apps, but not guaranteed.
 * Created by NickFirzen, with significant help from Grok (xAI). Other AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) may have contributed—honestly, it was chaos, I’m not a coder! :)
 * No shaders by others were used; any similarities are coincidental due to AI assistance. Sorry if that happened!
 * I’ve wanted something like this for ages. Hope you love it as much as I do!
 *
 * License: Free to use, modify, or build upon (MIT License). Feel free to:
 * - Create versions for 16:9/16:10 to fill letterboxes instead of pillarboxes.
 * - Combine with other shaders/presets (e.g., add image backgrounds, alpha-transparent PNGs like window/TV frames or landscapes).
 *
 * Find me as NickFirzen on Ko-fi, YouTube, or elsewhere if you want to support me in anyway!
 * Ultrawide FTW!
